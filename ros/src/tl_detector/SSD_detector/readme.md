### a SSD traffic light detector by using TensorFlow model API





we use  [COCO pre-trained network](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) models (ssd_inception_v2_coco)



There are some test output images from simulator:

**NOTE:** 

The Udacity Capstone request use 1.3.0 version of TensorFlow, you can use the older version models API to train your dataset.
